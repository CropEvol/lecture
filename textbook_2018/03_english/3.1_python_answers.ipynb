On the other hand, Watterson's $\\theta$ is estimated from the number of sequences and the variation of alleles. So real frequency of alleles is not used in Watterson's $\\theta$. Instead of it,  Watterson's $\\theta$ implicitly use the expected frequency of alleles from the number of sequences and the variation of alleles.   \n",

Secondaly, maybe, your samples include two different population. Then diversity is overestimated than expectation.  \n",

At first, maybe, that locus is affected by a (negative or positive) directional selection. Secondaly, maybe, your samples rapidly expand into new niche. So they don't accumulate expected amount of mutations (almost like clone). Then diversity is underestimated than expectation."
